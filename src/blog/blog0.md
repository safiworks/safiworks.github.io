Hello! This is my first ever blog post!

## Why Blog Post?
### Progress Updates
There is [this project](https://github.com/SafaOS/SafaOS) I have been working on for a year and a few months as of writing this, I found myself updating reddit with a new post every 2 months about its progress, for motivation.

I write a lot that people don't actually read, I thought it'd probably be better if I do it somewhere else with more details for people who are actually interested.

### It's fun
I doubt that anyone would be actually interested in progress updates, I want to do them however mainly because tracking progress sounds fun!

### Giving back
I also learnt alot from random blog posts, so I thought perhaps I can write something helpful too :3, and perhaps not we will see...


## This post's puropse
The puropse of this post is actually just to develop the UI I'll be using for future blog posts, there will be another post when I am done, so I'll leave you with some lorem ipsum, enjoy <3, and read the next post if you want to :3c.


### Lorem Ipsum
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque faucibus ex sapien vitae pellentesque sem placerat. In id cursus mi pretium tellus duis convallis. Tempus leo eu aenean sed diam urna tempor. Pulvinar vivamus fringilla lacus nec metus bibendum egestas. Iaculis massa nisl malesuada lacinia integer nunc posuere. Ut hendrerit semper vel class aptent taciti sociosqu. Ad litora torquent per conubia nostra inceptos himenaeos.

```rs
println!("lorem ipsum");

for i in xyz {
    // This is more optimized then:
    // println!("{}", i);
    println!("{i}");
}
```
